            In Week 3, Joe Burrow needed to prove himself as a top QB in the league in order for Fantasy team<br>
            managers to keep him in their starting line up. Fortunately, the Bengals Quarterback was able to have<br>
            a rebound week, throwing three touchdowns against the New York Jets, with a total of 275 yards passing.<br>
            We hope Joe Burrow continues to perform as he did this past week in next weeks matchup against the<br>
            Miami Dolphins, who have a perfect record so far this season. Joe Burrow is healthy and expected to<br>
            play.<br>

            Ja'Marr Chase has had a steady peformance throughout the first three weeks of the NFL season. However, <br>
            he has slowed down from his first weeks performance from a whopping 129 yards receiving. Chase will need <br>
            to be targeted more if he wants to improve upon his week 2 and 3 performances as he has shown in the past<br>
            he can be a top 10 wide receiver in the league. Ja'Marr Chase is healthy and scheduled to play against the<br>
            Miami Dolphins for this weeks matchup.<br>
